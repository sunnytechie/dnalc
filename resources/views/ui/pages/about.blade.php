                <h1>DNA Learning Center Nigeria</h1>
                <p>The DNALC Nigeria is an affiliate of DNA Learning Center New York that was licensed to bridge the educational gap by enhancing the bioscience education beginning from Nigeria to other nations in Africa. The overarching goal of the Center is to promote inquiry-based learning and hands-on laboratory experiences that prepare teachers, students, and families to benefit from modern genomics and biotechnology innovations in agricultural and medical research. DNALC Nigeria is additionally contributing to poverty and disease alleviation in Nigeria by preparing a new generation of highly skilled scientists and workforce to support agricultural and medical advancement.</p>

                <h2>Vision</h2>
                <p>The vision of DNA Learning Center Nigeria is to train the next generation of biological scientists who are equipped to solve African medical, agricultural, and environmental challenges by providing students with adequate hands-on laboratory and inquiry-based learning opportunities.</p>

                <h2>Mission</h2>
                <p>The mission of the DNA Learning Center is to prepare students and families to thrive in the gene age. We envision a day when all elementary students are exposed to principles of genetics and disease risk; when all high school students have the opportunity to do hands-on experiments with DNA; and when all families have access to genetic information, they need to make informed health care choices.</p>

                <h2>1.1 Major Collaborating Organizations</h2>

                <h3>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York</h3>
                <p>Founded in 1890, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory has shaped contemporary biomedical research and education with programs in cancer, neuroscience, plant biology, and quantitative biology. Home to eight Nobel Prize winners, the private, not-for-profit Laboratory employs 1,000 people, including 600 scientists, students, and technicians. The Meetings & Courses Program hosts more than 12,000 scientists from around the world each year on its campuses in Long Island and in Suzhou, China, with an impressive array of breakthroughs, patents, and contributions to Cancer, Neuroscience, Genomics, Quantitative Biology, Plant Biology, and forensic sciences. The Laboratory’s education arm also includes an academic publishing house, a graduate school, and programs for middle, high school, and undergraduate students and teachers who converge in their thousands at the various DNA Learning Centers across the world.</p>

                <h3>DNA Learning Center New York</h3>
                <p>DNA Learning Center (DNALC) New York is the world's first science center devoted entirely to public genetics education and is an operating unit of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, an important center for molecular genetics research. The DNALC NY extends the Laboratory's traditional research and postgraduate education mission to the college, precollege, and public levels. It is also the world’s largest provider of student lab instruction in molecular genetics, operating teaching laboratories throughout Long Island and Manhattan and more recently opened in China and Mexico. More than 280,000 precollege students have conducted hands-on experiments at the DNALC since its inception in 1988; an additional 145,000 have received intensive lab instruction from DNALC staff at their schools. Its multi-disciplinary staff has experience in elementary, secondary, and collegiate instruction; biochemistry and molecular biological research; forensics and industrial science, design, photography, and fine arts; science journalism; public relations and development; and opinion research.</p>

                <h3>Godfrey Okoye University</h3>
                <p>GOU was founded in 2009 to impart quality education aimed at inculcating in students’ strong personality that will ensure the promotion of religious, cultural, and epistemological dialogue. The vision of Godfrey Okoye University is to produce graduates who would be outstanding in learning, balanced in character, personality, and ready to pursue epistemic unity in all its ramifications. GOU’s philosophy is based on the nature of human beings as social beings and dialogue-seeking beings. From this point of view, the university understands education as a dialogical process of acquisition and dissemination of knowledge and will always cultivate relationships with industry practitioners that can translate academic discoveries into applicable products that can impact society. One of such is yearly town & gown meetings that have birthed many collaborations in training, grant funding, and business development with the global audience.</p>
