                <p>The management structure of the Center is divided into four cadres of staffing who oversee the day-to-day running of the Centers, especially the CeDFOCI, following this order:</p>

                <div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>(a) Senior Management Level Portfolios (SLP)</li>
                        <li>(b) Management or Middle Level Portfolios (MLP)</li>
                        <li>(c) Administrative Level Portfolios (ALP)</li>
                        <li>(d) Entry Level Portfolios (ELP)</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <br><br>

                <h2>1. Senior Management Level Portfolios (SLP)</h2>
                <p>The Senior Management team includes the Director, Deputy (ies), and Assistant Directors at DNALC Nigeria, including the Assistant Director in charge of CeDFOCI.</p>
                <div>

                        <li>The Assistant Director & Manager of CeDFOCI will be employed solely on merit and scores in STEM Expertise (Forensics) and administration (Forensic lab management) and can be selected from a global audience.</li>
                        <li>The Board of Trustees are not permitted to interfere with this process, as this will remain the key to success â€“ hiring very competent and intelligent individuals in spite of race, tribe, or origin.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
